# Programming for Lawyers

An introduction to programming for lawyers!  

_N.B. This programme is open to everyone but has been designed with an emphasis on helping laywers at Thrings LLP learn how to code._

## Welcome

Hello and weclcome to the programme.  This repository will evolve as we progress and is intended to be shaped to our collective needs.  I hope to collaborate with lawyers who are either experienced programmers and those who are ready to explore new ways or working and, importantly, new ways of *thinking*. 

I wrote an article about why I think lawyers have the ability (at least in theory) to be good programmers.  You can read it [here](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/why-lawyers-should-make-great-developers-155f73304d0).  I have since met and connected with lots of lawyers who code, coders who practice law, lawyers who (like me) have started LegalTech companies and everyone in between!  

The objective of this programme is not to become a software developer.  There are better resources for that if you are so inclined which I will mention below.  Rather it is to spark your enthusiasm for programming and ultimately, empower you to become a _more effective lawyer_.

So, let's begin. 

#### A little bit about me

I'm Jay, a laywer and programmer.  I'm not particularly keen on titles but I gravitate towards what some people describe as a "legal techologist".  I read Economics at university and started my career in law as a paralegal shortly after graduation.  I began my coding journey a few years ago and it has been extremly rewarding and fulfilling.  But this isn't about my journey - it's about yours!

I'd love it if you connected with me on Twitter - my handle is [@mrjaypeasmith](https://twitter.com/mrjaypeasmith) - and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jermainepaulsmith/) if you have a profile. 

### Equipment you will find helpful

In order to access the resources shsared in this programme, I recommend:

- a computer
- a smartphone
- internet connection 
- headphones 
- a notebook

### Setup recommendations

The initial part of the programme won't require any installation of software.  But you may want to work at your own (perhaps faster) pace so I have set out some options below. 

#### Create a GitHub Account

You should setup a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.  GitHub is platform where code is stored and shared for projects big and small - just like this one.  Having an account will be useful as you can use it as a gateway to a large number of programming resoruces.  By having a GitHub account you won't have to have uniqiue login credentials for other websites you use where GitHub authentication is supported. 

You'll discover as we progress that GitHub is referred to in a lot of resrouces and it is important to become comfortable with it and the underlying *version control* protocol itself called Git.

#### Install a code editor

You can write code in simple text editors but your experience will be enahced if you use a code editor.  There are some such as [repl.it](https://repl.it) and [codepen](https://codepen.io) which are browser based where you don't have to download anything to your computer to write code.  These are really useful tools particularly for small examples, sharing code or where you are working on a work laptop and cannot instal applications yourself. We will explore browser based code editors where needed. 

You may find that eventually you reach the contraints of browser based code editors and want to install something locally. _I recommend that you install_ [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - it is a superb free code editor and has a lot of tools and plugins to boost your productivity.


## Chapter 1: An introduction to Python

If we are going to learn how to code, we must pick a programming language.  Python is an excellent choice for, particulalry for lawyers. Python is an appealing choice for a number of reasons, for example it:

- has a shallow learning curve
- is versatile
- is popular for automating tasks
- has large number of libraries 
- can be used for AI and data science 

### Learning the fundamentals

It is important to start with the fundamentals when learning any programming language, particulalry if you've never written code before. 

**Required**: Take this [free online Python course](https://scrimba.com/course/gpython) on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).  Scrimba is a hybrid video tutorial / code editor.  It's important to get used to typing code and Scrimba allows you to do this while you follow along. 

**Recommended** You should read this [Python Handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-python-guide-for-beginners/) on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) alongside the above course. 

**Bonus** If you want more video resources then I recommend this [Python Crash Course](https://youtu.be/JJmcL1N2KQs) by Brad Traversy.

## Chapter 2: Your first (small) project

The best way to learn is to build applications.  Having explored the fundamentals of Python, you are now ready for your first small project.
